I'm **FrontEnd/Mobile Developer**. My goal is to acquire new skills that will improve my performance and productivity, so that I can grow as a person and as a professional, adding more value to the team project. I have mainly knowledge in the construction of products in the areas of health care, digital real estate, education, crowdfunding, financial/banks and eco-commerce. Being challenged and keeping myself constantly learning are my motivators.
